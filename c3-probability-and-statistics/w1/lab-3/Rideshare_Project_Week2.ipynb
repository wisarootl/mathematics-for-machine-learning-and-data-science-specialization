    "To get a better grasp of the data it is very useful to learn a bit more about the values in each column. In the previous notebook you have already plotted some histograms of individual columns to see how the data is distributed. Now it's time to approach this more systematically. Let's look at the numeric values first. Pandas has a very useful function `.describe()`, which returns a new dataframe with summary statistics for each of the columns. Run the cell below to compute and display summary statistics for your dataset. The output is a new dataframe that contains the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value and 25%, 50% (median) and 75% quartiles for each of the columns. By now, you should be familiar with all of these statistics. If you need a refresher, check out the Week 2 Lesson 1 videos again. "
